github_database_task:
  description: >
    Analyze the codebase of the GitHub repository to identify the databases in use.
    Search for evidence of database systems or servers such as PostgresSQL, SQLite, MSSQL, Oracle, MySQL, MongoDB, Redis, or other databases.
    Focus on detecting database-related configurations, connection strings, query references, or specific mentions of database systems in the codebase.
  expected_output: >
    A comprehensive list of databases detected, including:
      - Database Name: The name of each database system identified in the codebase.
      - Description: Details about the database's presence in the codebase, such as configuration files, connection strings, or query patterns.

github_orm_task:
  description: >
    Analyze the codebase of the GitHub repository to identify all the ORM frameworks utilized. 
    Look for evidence of ORM frameworks such as SQLAlchemy, Django ORM, Hibernate, or others used for database interaction. 
    The analysis should include instances where these frameworks are directly or indirectly utilized in the codebase.
    Provide detailed insights into how each ORM is used, including database connections, models, and query construction.
  expected_output: >
    A comprehensive report of ORMs detected, including:
      - ORM Name: The name of each ORM framework identified (e.g., SQLAlchemy, Django ORM, Hibernate, Sequelize, etc.).
      - Description: Details about the presence and usage of the ORM in the codebase, such as:
          - Location: Files or modules where the ORM is used.
          - Models: Details about the database models defined.
          - Queries: Examples of query methods or constructs used (e.g., `.filter()`, `.all()`, `.join()`).
          - Configuration: Any configuration files or setup methods related to the ORM framework.

github_api_task:
  description: >
    Analyze the GitHub repository to identify all API endpoints defined in the codebase. 
    Extract detailed information about each API, including its endpoint, HTTP method, purpose, input parameters, and response structure.
    The analysis should consider frameworks such as Flask, FastAPI, Django, Express, or any custom implementation of APIs in the codebase.
  expected_output: >
    A comprehensive list of all API endpoints detected, including:
      - endpoint: The URL or route of the API endpoint.
      - method: The HTTP method used by the API endpoint (e.g., GET, POST, PUT, DELETE).
      - description: Details about the API endpoint, including its purpose and usage.
      - input_parameters: Details of expected input parameters for the API endpoint, including names, types, and constraints if available.
      - output_structure: Details describing the structure of the API response, including field names and types if defined.

github_api_databases_task:
  description: >
    Analyze and identify all API endpoints obtained from the previous task. 
    For each API, extract detailed information including the database tables it interacts with, 
    columns involved, queries executed, and types of database operations performed.
  expected_output: >
    A comprehensive list of all detected API endpoints, including:
      - endpoint: The URL or route of the API endpoint.
      - method: The HTTP method used by the API endpoint (e.g., GET, POST, PUT, DELETE).
      - description: Details about the API, its use case, and expected behavior.
      - database_tables: A list of database tables used by the API endpoint.
      - columns: A list of database columns involved in the API operation, if identifiable.
      - operations: A list of database operations performed (e.g., SELECT, INSERT, UPDATE, DELETE).
      - sql_queries: The SQL queries executed by the API, extracted directly from the codebase.
