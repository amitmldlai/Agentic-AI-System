Hello Mok Jeb,

Our recent inspection of the property at 456 Main St. revealed several issues in the kitchen area (section 3.9 of the report, pages 136-147). These issues include concerns with the kitchen island (items 1-3), countertop (item 4), sink (item 5), faucet (item 6), cabinets (item 7), appliances (item 8), backsplash (item 9), flooring (item 10), lighting (item 11), and ventilation (item 12). Detailed photographic evidence is included in the report for each item.

Please provide a quote or action plan for addressing these identified issues.

Best regards,
Amit
