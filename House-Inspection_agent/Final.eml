Dear Nick,

Our recent home inspection report for 456 Main St. identified several issues with the roof, documented in section 2.2 (pages 122-128).  These issues, detailed in items 1-12, appear to involve significant damage and require immediate attention. We require a detailed quote or action plan outlining the necessary repairs to address these concerns. Please include a breakdown of costs and estimated timeframe for completion.

Best regards,
Amit
